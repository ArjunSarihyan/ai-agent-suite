- **New Home Buyers (Score 5)**: Focused on specific needs like financing and home decor, they have moderate engagement that can be improved with precise content alignment.

- **College Students (Score 4)**: Although there is interest in educational resources and internship opportunities, their engagement does not match the urgency of working professionals or entrepreneurs.
